\section*{Introduction}
In this homework, I split the task of calculating the dot product of two vectors with length 10000000 each into the number of processors. That is, if a single processor was used, all the calculation was performed as a single batch. If 2 processors were used, each process calculated dot product of 5000000 length halves and then their result is summed. If 4 processors were used, each process calculated dot product of 2500000 length quarters, and so on. I ran 10 experiments for each amount of processors, as can be seen on my code as well. While I was plotting the graph, I first calculated the average runtime for each level of parallelism.
